👋 Hi everyone!
I am an Aeronautical Engineer with a Master in Data Science.
I have a strong knowledge about computer science and statistics and I am mainly interested in artificial intelligence and data science topics. I believe that artificial intelligence, when used correctly, can help us build a better world, and I want to contribute towards that. 

I am a curious resolute person, eager to learn. I consider myself very adaptable and a critical thinker who loves to solve problems in the most effective possible way. I am used to work in highly dynamic and multicultural work environments. 
What I value the most in a job position is having the opportunity to learn new things and face new challenges to keep developing both professionally and personally. 

To let you know a little bit more about my background, I completed a bachelor's and a master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering, focusing on new technologies throughout both of them. 
In 2019, I completed a two-year Master in Business Administration offered by Beihang University (Beijing). During that time I lived one year in China and studied a second year while working in Spain.
Currently I am coursing a Master's degree in Data Science focusing on practical skills.

Have a nice day!
